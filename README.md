# aems-apilib
This library is used to generate the JSON-Body that will be sent to the AEMS-API. Note that this library does not (yet)
support the actual API communication. 

# General usage
To perform an action that requires authentication, you must supply the users credentials. You can do so by creating an instance
of an `AemsUser` object and passing that to your `Action` object. For example:
```java
AemsUser user = new AemsUser(userId, username, password);
AemsInsertAction insert = new AemsInsertAction(user);
```
## The authentication string
The authentication string is used to authorize at the AEMS-API. It is calculated using the users ID, username, password and a random salt. If the salt is not disabled, it will appear in the JSON string that is generated by calling `action.toJson()`.
## Managing the SALT
By default, a random salt will be applied to the users authentication string. If you wish to disable it, you can do so by calling
```java
myAction.disableSalt();
```
